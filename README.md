# Proof Of Concept: Shiny App with Fixed Layout 

Real Dashboards need full control over placement and sizing of widgets. 

This is an approach using div container with 'fixed' size and 'fixed' placement
to achieve this goal. The acutal thing fixed is the relative size and the 
relative position in relation to the window as an percentage of height and width
injected via CSS.
